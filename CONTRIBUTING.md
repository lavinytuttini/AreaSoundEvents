# Contribute to the project

This project uses a branch flow based on `master` for stable releases and `develop` for active development. Follow these steps to contribute:

1. **Clone** the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lavinytuttini/AreaSoundEvents.git
   
2. **Switch to** the **develop** branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout develop

3. **Create a new branch** based on develop:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b my-new-branch develop

4. **Make your changes, commit them, and push** them to your remote repository:
   ```bash
   git push origin my-new-branch

5. **Create** a **Pull Request** to develop:
   - Make sure to compare your branch with develop.

6. **Wait for review and approval** before merging.
```yaml
---

### Expected result
With this:
- Users will be able to create branches and submit PRs to `develop`.
- Only me will be able to approve and merge PRs.
- No one will be able to push directly to `develop` or `main`.

If you need more help with any step, let me know. ðŸ˜Š
